you have to submit the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.
we use nmap to scan the required ports using the following command
nmap localhost -p31000-32000
we get a list of addresses 
then we check which of the following is configured to connect to a no  ssl connection
echo JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1 | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790
check both the open porte one gives us the rsa key
